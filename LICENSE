 Can you explain briefly what the GNU Affero GPL is? We offer the
 source code of our websites to our users. The GNU Affero GPL has the
 requirement that anyone else using that code for their own websites
 also does the courtesy of offering the source code to their users.
 
 Why not use the GPL? The GPL guarantees that anyone who gets a binary
 version of the software also gets the source code so they can modify
 it. Since users of websites never get the binary, just HTML pages, it
 is no better a license than a BSD style license would be for them.
 For this reason, we use the GNU Affero GPL.
